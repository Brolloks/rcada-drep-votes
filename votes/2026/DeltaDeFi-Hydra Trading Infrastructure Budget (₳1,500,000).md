## Summary
**What the proposal is:**  
This Budget Info Action asks the Cardano community to signal support for allocating ₳1,500,000 over six months to harden, scale, and productionize DeltaDeFi’s Hydra-based order-book DEX, alongside a Vision 2030 DeFi KPI Measurement Programme.

**Key reason RCADA voted NO:**  
While RCADA recognises the technical merit, open-source contributions, and effort behind the proposal, we believe the request remains too tightly coupled to the productionization and growth of a single commercial venue to justify a treasury-level budget signal at this scale. The proposal does not sufficiently separate ecosystem-wide, non-exclusive infrastructure from product-specific execution, which is a critical distinction for treasury prioritisation.

**Signal communicated:**  
RCADA would be materially more supportive of a restructured proposal that isolates and funds neutral, reusable Hydra components, benchmarks, tooling, and observability infrastructure, with product-specific scaling and liquidity acquisition pursued via Catalyst or private funding.

## What this action does
This action records community sentiment on whether dedicating ₳1.5M of future treasury budget capacity toward DeltaDeFi’s Hydra-based trading infrastructure and associated KPI reporting is desirable in principle. It does not move treasury funds, but it sets directional precedent for future Treasury Withdrawal governance actions.

## Analysis Findings

### Constitutional / Guardrails Assessment
- ✔ Fits within the broad scope of Article IV.1 as a proposal for future ecosystem development
- ✔ Recognises the distinction between an Info Action and a future Treasury Withdrawal
- ⚠ Relies on future commitments (administrator designation, audit scope, fund segregation) rather than enforceable specifics at this stage
- ❌ Insufficient separation between public infrastructure funding and single-venue operational funding for a budget signal of this size

**Assessment: Conditional**
(Constitutionally admissible as an Info Action, but not sufficiently mature for a strong treasury-priority signal.)

---

### Process & Governance Quality
- **Clarity & structure:** High-quality narrative, detailed roadmap, and thoughtful KPI framing
- **Bundling / admin designation:** Combines ecosystem infrastructure goals with product-specific execution and venue operations
- **Auditability:** Audit intent acknowledged, but scope, methodology, and verification criteria remain underspecified
- **Precedent risk:** Signals acceptance of treasury funding for branded commercial venues rather than neutral infrastructure

**Assessment: Mixed**

---

### Impact & Risk Analysis
**Ecosystem benefit:**
- Positive spillovers via Hydra validation and open-source contributions
- However, benefits are indirect and contingent on DeltaDeFi’s success as a venue

**Execution risk:**
- High operational complexity (Hydra ops, liquidity, market quality)
- Lack of explicit acceptance criteria, trust model, and liquidity mechanics increases delivery risk

**Financial / governance risk:**
- ₳1.5M is material in a post-Voltaire treasury environment
- Risk of setting precedent for subsidising individual application-layer winners

**Assessment: Medium–High**

## RCADA Rationale

RCADA recognises the substantial effort, technical competence, and ecosystem commitment demonstrated in this proposal. The DeltaDeFi team has a strong open-source track record, and their work contributes valuable learnings toward validating Hydra in real-world DeFi contexts. The inclusion of KPI baselining and public dashboards reflects a commendable push toward accountability that we would like to see more broadly across governance proposals.

However, for a ₳1,500,000 budget signal, RCADA believes treasury funding should be reserved primarily for **non-exclusive, ecosystem-wide infrastructure** whose benefits accrue regardless of which individual application succeeds. As currently structured, this proposal remains predominantly focused on the productionization, operation, and competitiveness of a single branded trading venue, with ecosystem benefits that are indirect and dependent on that venue’s adoption.

We do not view this as a rejection of Hydra-based trading infrastructure, nor of the DeltaDeFi team’s work. Rather, it reflects a view that the **funding lane and scope are misaligned**. Product-specific scaling, liquidity acquisition, and venue operations are more appropriately addressed through Project Catalyst or private capital, while the treasury should prioritise reusable components, benchmarks, tooling, and observability infrastructure that the entire ecosystem can build upon.

For these reasons, RCADA votes **NO** on this Budget Info Action, while encouraging the proposers to consider a restructured, narrower request focused explicitly on neutral Hydra infrastructure and public-goods deliverables. Such a revision would materially change our level of support in future governance actions.

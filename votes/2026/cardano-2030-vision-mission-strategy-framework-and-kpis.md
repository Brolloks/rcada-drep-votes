## Summary
- Info Action proposing a community-led Vision, Mission, Strategy framework, and KPIs for Cardano through 2030.
- RCADA abstained due to insufficient governance actionability and decentralization safeguards at this stage.

---

## What this action does
This Info Action invites the Cardano community to signal support for a proposed long-term Vision, Mission, Strategy framework, and associated KPIs intended to guide ecosystem alignment and inform future governance and treasury discussions. The action is explicitly non-binding and does not enact protocol changes, treasury withdrawals, or constitutional amendments.

## RCADA Rationale

This Info action reflects a substantial, good-faith effort by the Intersect Product Committee to articulate a shared long-term Vision, Mission, Strategy framework, and KPIs for Cardano under full on-chain governance. The process followed was extensive, consultative, and well documented, involving broad community participation across workshops, surveys, SPO engagement, and dialogue with founding entities. From a governance-process perspective, this work meets a high standard of legitimacy and transparency.

RCADA agrees with the underlying motivation of the proposal. As Cardano transitions from protocol delivery into decentralized treasury governance, the absence of a commonly articulated strategic reference point increases the risk of fragmented decision-making, inconsistent resource allocation, and reactive governance driven by short-term narratives. The intent to provide DReps with shared language and long-term framing is reasonable and directionally aligned with the maturation of Cardano’s governance model.

However, RCADA does not believe this proposal, in its current form, is sufficiently actionable or decision-constraining to warrant an affirmative endorsement.

While the Vision and Mission statements are broadly aligned with Cardano’s historical identity, they remain highly abstract and do not meaningfully narrow governance decision space or establish explicit trade-offs. The five strategic pillars describe important domains of activity, but they are additive rather than prioritised, offering limited guidance on what should be de-prioritised or declined when resources, attention, or governance capacity are constrained. As such, the framework functions primarily as a consensus narrative rather than a governance tool.

RCADA places particular emphasis on decentralization as an active governance risk, not a background assumption. Although the strategy acknowledges decentralization and includes quantitative indicators—such as DRep voting power distribution, multi-client requirements, and a target of more than 500 independent stake pools—these thresholds are aspirational rather than disciplinary. From an SPO perspective, the “500 independent pools” target is especially concerning: it is a very low bar relative to Cardano’s current and historical decentralization levels and risks becoming a rhetorical shield for stake concentration rather than a safeguard against it. Large multi-pool operators could readily meet such a threshold while further marginalizing small, independent single-pool operators, using the KPI itself to justify outcomes that weaken decentralization in practice.

More broadly, the proposed KPIs, while more concrete than purely narrative statements, remain weakly coupled to governance decisions. They are useful as diagnostic or communicative indicators, but they do not clearly constrain treasury approvals, trigger corrective action, or define failure conditions that would materially discipline power or spending. This creates a risk that alignment with the strategy can be asserted rhetorically without demonstrable accountability or causality.

RCADA also notes that much of the strategic detail and iteration occurs off-chain as a living document. While this is appropriate for exploratory strategy development, it reinforces that this Info action functions primarily as acknowledgment rather than as a governance instrument. Endorsing such a framework on-chain without stronger decision hooks risks establishing soft precedent, where strategic narratives gain informal authority without corresponding mechanisms for challenge, revision, or enforcement by DReps.

For these reasons, RCADA has chosen to abstain on this action.

This abstention should not be interpreted as opposition to the intent, the process, or the value of strategic reflection. Rather, it signals that while this work represents a constructive and serious starting point, it does not yet meet the threshold of governance usefulness, decentralization protection, and decision discipline required for a supportive “Yes” vote. RCADA would welcome future iterations or follow-up actions that narrow scope, embed decentralization more explicitly, raise the bar on decentralization metrics, and more clearly link strategy and KPIs to concrete governance and treasury decisions.

RCADA remains committed to thoughtful, disciplined governance and to supporting approaches that strengthen Cardano’s long-term resilience, decentralization, and credibility. This abstention is intended as a constructive signal toward that end.

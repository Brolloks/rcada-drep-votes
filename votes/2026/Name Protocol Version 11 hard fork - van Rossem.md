## RCADA Rationale

This governance action proposes naming Cardano Protocol Version 11 the “van Rossem Hard Fork” in memory of Max van Rossem, a respected contributor to the Cardano community and its governance foundations.

RCADA recognises that naming hard forks has long served as a symbolic tradition within Cardano, reflecting milestones in the protocol’s evolution while honouring individuals whose contributions have had lasting impact. This proposal continues that tradition and has received broad support across the DRep community.

Max van Rossem made meaningful contributions to Cardano’s governance development, including constitutional discussions, participation in the Constitutional Convention, and sustained community representation through the Dutch DRep Collective. He also contributed to the election process of the first fully community-elected Constitutional Committee and supported governance coordination efforts that will continue to shape the network’s future.

From a governance perspective, this action is intentionally narrow in scope, constitutionally neutral, and non-precedent-expanding beyond the continuation of an established naming practice. It does not affect protocol rules, treasury access, or governance authority, and therefore does not raise concerns related to guardrails, fiscal discipline, or decentralisation resilience.

RCADA also acknowledges the broader community sentiment expressed by many DReps in support of this proposal and supports the naming in that spirit. For these reasons, RCADA votes **YES**.

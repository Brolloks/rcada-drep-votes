# RCADA DRep Governance Policy

This page explains how RCADA approaches on-chain governance, how votes are evaluated, and how to read the voting records published in this repository.

Our goal is to provide **transparent, consistent, and accountable representation** for delegators while supporting the long-term sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem.

## Principles

RCADA’s governance approach is guided by the following principles:

- **Constitution-first governance**  
  All actions are assessed against the Cardano Constitution and guardrails before any other consideration.

- **Process matters as much as outcomes**  
  Strong ideas presented through weak governance processes are treated with caution.

- **Long-term sustainability over short-term momentum**  
  We prioritise decisions that strengthen decentralisation, resilience, and institutional credibility.

- **Transparency by default**  
  Every vote includes a public, written rationale explaining how and why the decision was reached.

## How Votes Are Recorded

Each governance action is recorded as a **single Markdown file** containing:

1. **Metadata (Index Card)**  
   At the top of each file is a structured metadata block that records:
   - Governance Action ID
   - Action type
   - Vote (Yes / No / Abstain)
   - Vote date and expiry
   - Status (Draft or Committed)

   This metadata is the **single source of truth** for what vote was cast.

2. **Analysis & Findings**  
   Structured sections covering:
   - Constitutional and guardrails assessment
   - Governance and process quality
   - Impact and risk considerations
   - Optional internal scoring used as decision support

3. **RCADA Rationale**  
   A full narrative explanation, written in the same style as RCADA’s historical DRep rationales.  
   This section explains *why* the vote recorded above was cast.

Votes are **not duplicated** elsewhere in the document to avoid inconsistency or administrative overhead.

---

## Use of Abstain Votes

An **Abstain** vote is an intentional governance signal, not a lack of participation.

RCADA may abstain when:
- The intent of a proposal is reasonable but execution or process quality is weak
- Proposals are bundled in a way that prevents granular decision-making
- An Info action is being used to imply endorsement without accountability

Abstentions are used to encourage **better governance design**, not to avoid responsibility.

---

## Draft vs Committed Votes

- **Draft**  
  Indicates analysis in progress. The vote has not yet been cast on-chain.

- **Committed**  
  Indicates the vote has been submitted on-chain and is final.

Only **Committed** votes should be treated as authoritative governance actions.

---

## Accountability to Delegators

This repository is intended to:
- Provide a permanent, auditable record of RCADA’s governance activity
- Allow delegators to understand not just *what* was voted, but *why*
- Ensure consistency across time, even as governance evolves

Delegators are encouraged to review past votes and rationales and to engage with RCADA if clarification is ever needed.

## Closing Note

Governance is an evolving process.  
RCADA’s methodology is designed to remain flexible while maintaining constitutional integrity, transparency, and respect for the collective stewardship of the Cardano ecosystem.

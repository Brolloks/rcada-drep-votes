## How to read a vote page
Each vote page includes:
- Governance metadata (action id, type, expiry)
- The vote cast (Yes / No / Abstain)
- Full rationale in RCADA’s voice
- Links to supporting material (when available)

## Notes
- “Info” actions are often treated as sentiment signals and process tests, not direct authorizations.
- Treasury withdrawals and protocol changes are assessed against constitutional/guardrail expectations and governance quality.
